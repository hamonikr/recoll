.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B recollindex
command is the Recoll indexer.
.PP
As indexing can sometimes take a long time, the command can be interrupted
by sending an interrupt (Ctrl-C, SIGINT) or terminate (SIGTERM)
signal. Some time may elapse before the process exits, because it needs to
properly flush and close the index. This can also be done from the recoll
GUI (menu entry: File/Stop_Indexing). After such an interruption, the index
will be somewhat inconsistent because some operations which are normally
performed at the end of the indexing pass will have been skipped (for
example, the stemming and spelling databases will be inexistent or out of
date). You just need to restart indexing at a later time to restore
consistency. The indexing will restart at the interruption point (the full
file tree will be traversed, but files that were indexed up to the
interruption and for which the index is still up to date will not need to
be reindexed).
.PP
The 
.B \-c 
option specifies the configuration directory name, overriding the
default or $RECOLL_CONFDIR.
.PP
There are several modes of operation. 
.PP
The normal mode will index the set of files described in the configuration
file 
.B recoll.conf.
This will incrementally update the database with files that changed since
the last run. If option 
.B \-z 
is given, the database will be erased before starting. If option
.B \-Z 
is given, the database will not be reset, but all files will be considered
as needing reindexing (in place reset).
.PP
As of version 1.21, 
.B recollindex
usually does not process again files which previously failed to index (for
example because of a missing helper program). If option
.B \-k
is given, 
.B recollindex
will try again to process all failed files. Please note that 
.B recollindex
may also decide to retry failed files if the auxiliary checking script
defined by the "checkneedretryindexscript" configuration variable indicates
that this should happen.
.PP
If option
.B \--diagsfile
is given, the path given as parameter will be truncated and indexing
diagnostics will be written to it. Each line in the file will have a
diagnostic type (reason for the file not to be indexed), the file path, and
a possible additional piece of information, which can be the MIME type or
the archive internal path depending on the issue. The following diagnostic
types are currently defined:
.IP
.B Skipped
: the path matches an element of
.B skippedPaths or
.B skippedNames.
.IP
.B NoContentSuffix
: the file name suffix is found in the
.B noContentSuffixes
list.
.IP
.B MissingHelper
: a helper program is missing.
.IP
.B Error
: general error (see the log).
.IP
.B NoHandler: no handler is defined for the MIME type.
.IP
.B ExcludedMime
: the MIME type is part of the
.B excludedmimetypes
list.
.IP
.B NotIncludedMime
: the
.B onlymimetypes
list is not empty and the the MIME type is not in it.
.PP
If option 
.B
\-m 
is given, recollindex is started for real time monitoring, using the
file system monitoring package it was configured for (either fam, gamin, or
inotify). This mode must have been explicitly configured when building the
package, it is not available by default. The program will normally detach
from the controlling terminal and become a daemon. If option
.B
\-D 
is given, it will stay in the foreground. Option
.B
\-w 
<seconds> can be used to specify that the program should sleep for the
specified time before indexing begins. The default value is 60. The daemon
normally monitors the X11 session and exits when it is reset.
Option 
.B
\-x
disables this X11 session monitoring (daemon will stay alive even if it
cannot connect to the X11 server). You need to use this too if you use the
daemon without an X11 context. You can use option
.B
\-n
to skip the initial incrementing pass which is normally performed before
monitoring starts. Once monitoring is started, the daemon normally monitors
the configuration and restarts from scratch if a change is made. You can
disable this with option
.B
\-C
.PP
.B recollindex \-i
will index individual files into the database. The stem expansion and
aspell databases will not be updated. The skippedPaths and skippedNames
configuration variables will be used, so that some files may be
skipped. You can tell recollindex to ignore skippedPaths and skippedNames
by setting the 
.B
\-f option. This allows fully custom file selection for a given subtree,
for which you would add the top directory to skippedPaths, and use any
custom tool to generate the file list (ie: a tool from a source code
control system). When run this way, the indexer normally does not perform
the deleted files purge pass, because it cannot be sure to have seen all
the existing files. You can force a purge pass with
.B
\-P.
.PP
.B recollindex \-e
will erase data for individual files from the database. The stem expansion
databases will not be updated.
.PP
Options
.B
\-i
and
.B
\-e
can be combined. This will first perform the purge, then the indexing.
.PP
With options 
.B \-i 
or 
.B \-e 
, if no file names are given on the command line, they
will be read from stdin, so that you could for example run:
.PP
find /path/to/dir \-print | recollindex \-e \-i
.PP
to force the reindexing of a directory tree (which has to exist inside the
file system area defined by
.I topdirs 
in recoll.conf). You could mostly accomplish the same thing with
.PP
find /path/to/dir \-print | recollindex \-Z \-i
.PP
The latter will perform a less thorough job of purging stale sub-documents
though.
.PP
.B recollindex \-r
mostly works like 
.B \-i
, but the parameter is a single directory, which will
be recursively updated. This mostly does nothing more than 
.B find topdir | recollindex \-i
but it may be more convenient to use when started from another
program. This retries failed files by default, use option
.B \-K
to change. One or multiple 
.B \-p
options can be used to set shell-type selection patterns (e.g.: *.pdf).
.PP
.B recollindex \-l 
will list the names of available language stemmers.
.PP
.B recollindex \-s 
will build the stem expansion database for a given language, which may or
may not be part of the list in the configuration file. If the language is
not part of the configuration, the stem expansion database will be deleted
at the end of the next normal indexing run. You can get the list of stemmer
names from the 
.B recollindex \-l
command. Note that this is mostly for experimental use, the normal way to
add a stemming language is to set it in the configuration, either by
editing "recoll.conf" or by using the GUI indexing configuration dialog.

.PP
.B recollindex \-S
will rebuild the phonetic/orthographic index. This feature uses the 
.B aspell
package, which must be installed on the system.
.PP
.B recollindex \-E
will check the configuration file for topdirs and other relevant paths
existence (to help catch typos).
.PP
.B recollindex \--webcache-compact
will recover the space wasted by erased page instances inside the Web
cache. It may temporarily need to use twice the disk space used by the Web
cache.
.PP
.B recollindex \--webcache-burst <destdir>
will extract all entries from the Web cache to files created inside
<destdir>. Each cache entry is extracted as two files, for the data and metadata.
.PP
.B recollindex \--notindexed [path [path ...]]
will check each path and print out those which are absent from the index
(with an "ABSENT" prefix), or caused an indexing error (with an "ERROR"
prefix). If no paths are given on the command line, the command will read
them, one per line, from stdin.
