# Associations of file name extensions to mime types
#
# All entries must be in lower case characters. File name extensions are
# lower-cased for comparison during indexing, meaning that an upper or
# mixed case entry will never be matched.
#
# When creating a temporary file for a MIME type (e.g. temp file for
# display), the FIRST entry for the MIME type will be used to determine the
# file suffix. This may be important if the app used does not grok all the
# possible suffixes.

# Defining them with specific types allows using a specific ext viewer (in

# indexing the contents (and rough preview). You could also just set them
