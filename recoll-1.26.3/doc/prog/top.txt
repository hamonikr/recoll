\section intro Introduction

Home page: http://www.recoll.org

This is the documentation for Recoll, a personal text search tool. Recoll
is written in C++, has a QT-based gui and uses the <a
href="http://www.xapian.org">Xapian</a> full text search engine.

Recoll supports a number of document types, the decoding of which is either
performed with internal code or an externally executed, program. 

It should be relatively easy to write a new filter for some yet unsupported
file type, and the documentation for this is found here: <a
href="filters.html">Writing input filters</a>
