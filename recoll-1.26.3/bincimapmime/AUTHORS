Author:
Andreas Aardal Hanssen                  <andreas-binc@bincimap.org>

Several users have been very helpful with bug reports and suggestions, and
the author is very grateful for their contributions.

Some users have also gone to the extra effort of debugging the cause of a
bug, or have found a way of implementing a feature, and have either provided
a very good description of what is needed, or they have actually provided a
patch that has been added to Binc IMAP.

While adding extra value to the discussion around the discovery of a bug or
the evaluation of a new feature, these contributors also take some load of
the author's back, so they deserve extra thanks.

In this list are also included people who have contributed with mirrors and
translations of the web pages.
