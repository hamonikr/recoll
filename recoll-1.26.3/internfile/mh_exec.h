 * Turn external document into internal one by executing an external command.
 *
 * The command to execute, and its parameters, are defined in the mimeconf
 * configuration file, and stored by mimehandler.cpp in the object when it is
 * built. This data is not reset by a clear() call.
 *
 * The output MIME type (typically text/plain or text/html) and output
 * character set are also defined in mimeconf. The default is text/html, utf-8
 *
 * The command will write the document text to stdout. Its only way to
 * set metadata is through "meta" tags if the output MIME is
 * text/html.
 *
 * As any RecollFilter, a MimeHandlerExec object can be reset
 * by calling clear(), and will stay initialised for the same mtype
 * (cmd, params etc.)
