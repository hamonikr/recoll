What is it ?
------------

unac is a C library that removes accents from characters, regardless
of the character set (ISO-8859-15, ISO-CELTIC, KOI8-RU...)  as long as
iconv(3) is able to convert it into UTF-16 (Unicode).  For instance
the string été will become ete.  It provides a command line interface
(unaccent) that removes accents from an input flow or a string given
in argument. When using the library function or the command, the
charset of the input must be specified. The input is converted to
UTF-16 using iconv(3), accents are removed and the result is converted
back to the original charset. The iconv -l command on GNU/Linux will
show all charset supported.

Where is the documentation ?
----------------------------

The manual page of the unaccent command : man unaccent.
The manual page of the unac library : man unac.

How to install it ?
