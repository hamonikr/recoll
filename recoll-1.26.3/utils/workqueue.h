/**
 * A WorkQueue manages the synchronisation around a queue of work items,
 * where a number of client threads queue tasks and a number of worker
 * threads take and execute them. The goal is to introduce some level
 * of parallelism between the successive steps of a previously single
 * threaded pipeline. For example data extraction / data preparation / index
 * update, but this could have other uses.
 *
 * There is no individual task status return. In case of fatal error,
 * the client or worker sets an end condition on the queue. A second
 * queue could conceivably be used for returning individual task
 * status.
 *
 * The strange thread functions argument and return values
 * comes from compatibility with an earlier pthread-based
 * implementation.
